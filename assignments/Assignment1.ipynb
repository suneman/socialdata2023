    "We started the course by plotting simple histogram and bar plots that showed a lot of cool patterns. But sometimes the binning can hide imprecision, irregularity, and simple errors in the data that could be misleading.

    "The data errors we discovered at the end of Week 4 become difficult to notice when we aggregate data (and when we calculate mean values, as well as statistics more generally).
