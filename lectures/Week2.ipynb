    "Start by downloading these four datasets: [Data 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2023/main/files/data1.tsv), [Data 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2023/main/files/data2.tsv), [Data 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2023/main/files/data3.tsv), and [Data 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2023/main/files/data4.tsv). The format is `.tsv`, which stands for _tab separated values_. \n",
    "As you will later realize, these are famous datasets!\n",
    "Each file has two columns (separated using the tab character). The first column is $x$-values, and the second column is $y$-values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's ok to just download these files to disk by right-clicking on each one, but if you use Python and `urllib` or `urllib2` to get them, I'll really be impressed. If you don't know how to do that, I recommend opening up Google and typing \"download file using Python\" or something like that. When interpreting the search results remember that _stackoverflow_ is your friend.\n",

    "Now, to the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Exercise*: \n",
    "> \n",
    "> * Using the `numpy` function `mean`, calculate the mean of both $x$-values and $y$-values for each dataset. \n",
    ">      * Use python string formatting to print precisely two decimal places of these results to the output cell. Check out [this _stackoverflow_ page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8885663/how-to-format-a-floating-number-to-fixed-width-in-python) for help with the string formatting. \n",
    "> * Now calculate the variance for all of the various sets of $x$- and $y$-values, by using the `numpy` function `var`. Print it to three decimal places.\n",
    "> * Use `numpy` to calculate the [Pearson correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) between $x$- and $y$-values for all four data sets (also print to three decimal places).\n",
    "> * The next step is use _linear regression_ to fit a straight line $f(x) = a x + b$ through each dataset and report $a$ and $b$ (to two decimal places). An easy way to fit a straight line in Python is using `scipy`'s `linregress`. It works like this\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> from scipy import stats\n",
    "> slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(x,y)\n",
    ">```\n",
    "> * Comment on the results from the previous steps. What do you observe? \n",
    "> * Finally, it's time to plot the four datasets using `matplotlib.pyplot`. Use a two-by-two [`subplot`](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/subplot_demo.html) to put all of the plots nicely in a grid and use the same $x$ and $y$ range for all four plots. And include the linear fit in all four plots. (To get a sense of what I think the plot should look like, you can take a look at my version [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2023/main/files/anscombe.png).)\n",
    "> * Explain - in your own words - what you think my point with this exercise is (see below for tips on this).\n",

    "\n",
    "Get more insight in the ideas behind this exercise by reading [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). Here you can also get an explanation of why the datasets are actually famous - I mean they have their own Wikipedia page!!"
