However, exploratory data analysis means to be able to explore the multi-faceted nature of data and *interactive dataviz* is a handy tool to do it! It allows to play with the data: Toggle the view.

    "To really master interactive visualizations, you will need to work with JavaScript, especially [D3](https://d3js.org). Given the limited time available for this class, we can't squeeze that in. But luckily Python has some pretty good options for interactive visualizations. You can find a range of different options [here](https://mode.com/blog/python-interactive-plot-libraries/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll explore [`Bokeh`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/), which provides lots of nice interactive funtionalities to Python. To work with Bokeh, we first set up our system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you haven't installed it yet please do so. You can simply follow [these steps](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/installation.html)\n",

    "2. To include Bokeh in your notebooks you can follow the [Bokeh: Using with Jupyter](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/output/jupyter.html#jupyter) guide. Come back to this one when you need it\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We aim to give you a gentle start with Bokeh and I am going to include more example code than usual in the follwing.\n",
    "   * **HINT 1**: If you're not an experienced Python user, I recommend going to the [official user's guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html#userguide) and working through it. Start by clicking \"Introduction\" in the linked page. That page has a glossary, a section on output methods, stuff on settings, and interfaces that you can scroll through. The next page *Basic Plotting* where the action is. Spend some time working through that.\n",
    "   * **HINT 2**: And by \"working through it\", I mean copy, paste, and run the code in your own notebook. "

    "\n",
    "A key step is to set up the data right. So for this one, we'll be pretty strict about the steps. The workflow is\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the data for the period of 2010-2017 and group it by hour-of-the-day.\n",
    "2. We would like to be able to easily compare how the distribution of crimes differ from each other, not absolute numbers, so we will work on *normalized data*:\n",
    "    * To normalise data for within a crime category you simply to devide the count for each hour by the total number of this crime type. (To give a concrete example in the `ASSAULT` category, take the number of assault-counts in 1st hour you should devide by the total number of assaults, then you devide number of assaults in 2nd hour by the total number of assaults and so on)\n",
    "    *  Your life will be easiest if you organize your dataframe as shown in [this helpful screenshot](https://github.com/suneman/socialdata2023/blob/main/files/W6_Part2_data.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've followed these steps, your data should be ready! Take a moment to celebrate. We now follow the [Bokeh guide for categorical data](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic/bars.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, let's convert our **Pandas Dataframe** to **Bokeh ColumnDataSource**: \n",
    "  > ```python\n",
    "  > source = ColumnDataSource(your_processed_dataframe)\n",
    "  > ## it is a standard way to convert your df to bokeh\n",
    "  > ```\n",
    "2. We also need to create an empty figure (we will add our stuff here later on). Mini sub-exercise: Find the a guide how to define a figure in Bokeh online. Here is a little help:\n",
    "  > ```python\n",
    "  > p = figure(...., x_range = FactorRange(factors=hours), ...) \n",
    "  > #p is a standard way to call figures in Bokeh\n",
    "  > #make sure to add x_range. In my case hours is a list on the form ['1', '2', '3' ... , '24']\n",
    "  > #read up on the FactorRange in the guide\n",
    "  > #do not forget to add other attributes to the figure, e.g. title, axis names and so on\n",
    "  > ```\n",
    "3. Now we are going to add the bars. In order to do so, we will use **vbar** (see the guide for help):\n",
    "  > ```python\n",
    "  > bar ={} # to store vbars\n",
    "  > ### here we will do a for loop:\n",
    "  > for indx,i in enumerate(focuscrimes):\n",
    "  >     bar[i] = p.vbar(x='name_of_the_column_that_contain_hours',  top=i, source= src, \n",
    "  >                     ### we will create a vbar for each focuscrime\n",
    "  >                     legend_label=i,  muted_alpha=..., muted = ....) \n",
    "  > #i stands for a column that we use, top=y; we are specifying that our numbers comes from column i\n",
    "  > #read up what legend_label, muted and muted_alpha do... you can add more attributes (you HAVE TO)\n",
    "  > ```\n",
    "4. The last thing to do is to make your legend interactive and display the figure:\n",
    "  > ```python\n",
    "  > p.legend.click_policy=\"mute\" ### assigns the click policy (you can try to use ''hide'\n",
    "  > show(p) #displays your plot\n",
    "  > ```\n",
    "5. You will notice that the legend appears in the middle of the figure (and it occludes some of the data). In order to fix this look into [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26254619/position-of-the-legend-in-a-bokeh-plot) as a start. Below are some code snippets that you can use to deal with this problem (but read the guide first):\n",
    "  > ```python\n",
    "  > items = [] ### for the custom legend // you need to figure out where to add it\n",
    "  > items.append((i, [bar[i]])) ### figure where to add it\n",
    "  > legend = Legend(items=..., location=.....) ## figure where to add it\n",
    "  > p.add_layout(...., ...) ## figure where to add it\n",
    "  > ### if you read the guide, it will make sense\n",
    "  > ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to recreate this amazing visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXTRA feature**: If you're interested in detailed instructions for more Bokeh visualizations for your final project, you can find more inspiration **[here](https://github.com/suneman/socialdata2021/blob/main/lectures/Week8_extra_bokeh.ipynb)**."
