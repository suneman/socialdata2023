It's pretty old, but I think it's a fantastic resource and one that is pretty much as relevant now as it was back then. The author is a physicist (like Sune) so he likes the way he thinks. And the books takes the reader all the way from visualization, through modeling to computational mining. Anywho - it's a great book and well worth reading in its entirety. \n",

Sune didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to our advantage. We'll ask you to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading? \n",

    "> *Excercise Part 1*: Connecting the dots and recreating plots from DAOST but using our own favorite dataset.\n",
    "> * Let's make a jitter-plot (that is, code up something like **Figure 2-1** from DAOST from scratch), but based on *SF Police data*. My hunch from inspecting the file is that the police-folks might be a little bit lazy in noting down the **exact** time down to the second. So choose a crime-type and a suitable time interval (somewhere between a month and 6 months depending on the crime-type) and create a jitter plot of the arrest times during a single hour (like 13-14, for example). So let time run on the $x$-axis and create vertical jitter.\n",
    "> * Last time, we did lots of bar-plots. Today, we'll play around with histograms (creating two crime-data based versions of the plot-type shown in DAOST **Figure 2-2**). I think the GPS data could be fun to see this way. \n",
    ">   * This time, pick two crime-types with different geographical patterns **and** a suitable time-interval for each (you want between 1000 and 10000 points in your histogram)\n",
    ">   * Then take the latitude part of the GPS coordinates for each crime and bin the latitudes so that you have around 50 bins across the city of SF. You can use your favorite method for binning. I like `numpy.histogram`. This function gives you the counts and then you do your own plotting. \n",
    "> * Next up is using the plot-type shown in **Figure 2-4** from DAOST, but with the data you used to create Figure 2.1. There is not a single great way to create kernel density plots in Python. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/density-plots-with-pandas-in-python/), you'll finde a pandas based strategy, but you can also use `gaussian_kde` from `scipy.stats` ([for an example, check out this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4150171/how-to-create-a-density-plot-in-matplotlib)) or you can use [`seaborn.kdeplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html). There is also another nice tutorial for KDE plots [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/histograms-and-density-plots-in-python-f6bda88f5ac0).\n",
    "> * Now grab 25 random timepoints from the dataset (of 1000-10000 original data) you've just plotted and create a version of Figure 2-4 based on the 25 data points. Does this shed light on why I think KDEs can be misleading? \n",

    ">   * **Hint:** Take a look at the `scipy.stats.probplot` function. \n",
    "> * OK, we're almost done, but we need some box plots. Here, I'd like you to use the box plots to visualize fluctuations of how many crimes happen per day. We'll use data from the 15 focus crimes defined last week.\n",
    ">   * For the full time-span of the data, calulate the **number of crimes per day** within each category for the entire duration of the data.\n",
    ">   * Create a box-and whiskers plot showing the mean, median, quantiles, etc for all 15 crime-types side-by-side. There are many ways to do this. I like to use [matplotlibs's built in functionality](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html), but you can also achieve good results with [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html) or [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.boxplot.html).\n",
    ">   * What does this plot reveal that you can't see in the plots from last time?\n",
    "> * Also I want to show you guys another interesting use of box plots. To get started, let's calculate another average for each focus-crime, namely what time of day the crime happens. So this time, the distribution we want to plot is the average time-of-day that a crime takes place. There are many ways to do this, but let me describe one way to do it. \n",
    ">   * For datapoint, the only thing you care about is the time-of-day, so discard everything else.\n",
    ">   * You also have to deal with the fact that time is annoyingly not divided into nice units that go to 100 like many other numbers. I can think of two ways to deal with this.\n",
    ">     * For each time-of-day, simply encode it as seconds since midnight.\n",
    ">     * Or keep each whole hour, and convert the minute/second count to a percentage of an hour. So 10:15 $\\rightarrow$ 10.25, 8:40 $\\rightarrow$ 8.67, etc.\n",
    "> * Now you can create box-plots to create an overview of *when various crimes occur*. Note that these plot have quite a different interpretation than ones we created in the previous exercise. Cool, right?  "
